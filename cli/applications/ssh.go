By default, Cloud Foundry applications do not have SSH enabled.
Developers can use this command to allow SSH access to an application for debugging or direct interaction with the applicationâ€™s running environment.
Once SSH is enabled, a restart of the application is required before you can successfully SSH into it.

Usage:
  goli applications enable-ssh APP_NAME [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
  APP_NAME                
      The name of the application for which SSH access should be enabled.  
      This is a required argument and must be specified before any options.

Options:
  -h, --help                 
      Display this help message and exit.  

Examples:
  goli applications enable-ssh my-app
      Enable SSH access for the application named "my-app."  
      After enabling, you will need to restart the app to SSH into it.`,
